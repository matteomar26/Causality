Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracking the evolution of an epidemic is an interesting possibility to control
 it.
 Starting from the observations (i.e.
 the clinical tests) performed on the population, the goal is to obtain
 an estimate of the epidemic risk, namely the probability for each individual
 to be infected in function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Some models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we are going to introduce some diffused models in literature.
 Typically, although the epidemic process is by nature a continuous process
 in time, the dynamics is discretized.
 This is because many inferential methods are only able to address jdiscrete
 time process inference.
 For this reason we are going to introduce the SI model first in its discrete
 time form.
 The discrete SI model is also introduced for its semplicity.
 It is very easy to introduce and it includes many of the most important
 features of the epidemic inference.
 It can also be used, therefore, in order to give examples.
 However, since Causality is able to infere directly from the continuous
 model, we are also going to introduce the continuous dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discretized SI Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest epidemic model is a two states model in which each particle
 is either S (susceptible) or I (infected).
 At the initial time, there is a zero patient in the state I.
 All the other particles are in the state S.
 As time passes, the zero patient tries to infect one or more of its contacts
 with an infection probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 They, in turn, start to infect their contacts.
 In this model an I particle never comes back to the S state: the transition
 
\begin_inset Formula $I\to S$
\end_inset

 is forbidden.
 Let us call 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{t}$
\end_inset

 the state of particle 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{t}$
\end_inset

 can be either 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

.
 Since the transition 
\begin_inset Formula $I\to S$
\end_inset

 is forbidden, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{i}^{t+1}=S|x_{i}^{t}=I)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{i}^{t+1}=I|x_{i}^{t}=I)=1$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of generating a particular trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{0}(x_{i}^{0})\prod_{t=0}^{T-1}p_{i}^{t+1}\left(x_{i}^{t+1}|x_{i}^{t},x_{\partial i}^{t}\right)
\]

\end_inset

This equation is just the product over time of the transition probabilities
 multiplicated by the initial time probability:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=P^{0}(x^{0})\prod_{t=0}^{T-1}P^{t+1}\left(x^{t+1}|x^{t}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which factorizes over the particles provided that the neighbors' state st
 the previous time is provided.
 The transition probabilities of a particle depend indeed also on the state
 of its contacts.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}^{t}$
\end_inset

 as the probability for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to infect 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{t}=I$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{t}=S$
\end_inset

, it is easy to write the transition probabilities:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{i}^{t+1}\left(x_{i}^{t+1}=S|x_{i}^{t}=S,x_{\partial i}^{t}\right)=\prod_{j\in\partial i}\left(1-\lambda_{ji}^{t}\delta_{x_{j}^{t},I}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The transition 
\begin_inset Formula $S\to I$
\end_inset

 is obtained by normalization and the transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $I\to S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I\to I$
\end_inset

 are described above.
 As a consequence the probability to generate a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the product of the probabilities of being the zero patient 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(x_{i}^{0})$
\end_inset

 multiplicated by the product over time and particles of the transition
 probabilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SI Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already discussed, the epidemic models are for their nature continuous
 in time.
 Their discretizations is done to simplify them and to make simpler examples.
 Since our method does not need this semplification in order to work, we
 will not approximate the continuous dynamics with a discrete one.
 For this reason we are now going to introduce the SI model in its continuous
 form.
 In this case it is not possbile to use the single time states 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{t}$
\end_inset

 to write the global probability.
 We then simply change variables by introducing the infection time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 for every particle 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\dots,N$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{i}^{t}=\begin{cases}
S & t<t_{i}\\
I & t\geq t_{i}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

(note that this change of variables can be done also in the discretized
 case).
 Thus, the complete dynamics is specified by providing every 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\dots,N$
\end_inset

.
 In the continuous case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}^{t}$
\end_inset

 is the rate of infection from 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}\leq t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}>t$
\end_inset

.
 Let us define 
\begin_inset Formula $y:=\left(t_{1},\dots,t_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 as the trajectory vector made of all the infection times 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 of each particle 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\dots,N$
\end_inset

.
 The probability denisty of generating a particular trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\left(t_{1},\dots,t_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(y)=\prod_{i}p_{0}^{i}(t_{i})\left(\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\prod_{j\in\partial i}\exp\left\{ -\intop_{t_{j}}^{t_{i}-\epsilon}\lambda_{ji}^{t}\mathrm{d}t\right\} \bigg|_{\epsilon=0}\right)\label{eq:Intro:SI_continuous}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This formula can be obtained by the discrete case by changing the variables
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and by substituting the transition probabilities: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P\left(\mathbf{y}\right) & =\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{0}(t_{i})\left(\prod_{t=0}^{t_{i}-2}\prod_{j\in\partial i}\left(1-\lambda_{ji}^{t}\theta\left(t-t_{j}\right)\right)\right)\left(1-\prod_{j\in\partial i}\left(1-\lambda_{ji}^{t_{i}-1}\theta\left(t_{i}-1-t_{j}\right)\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is equal, by distributing the product, to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P\left(\mathbf{y}\right) & =\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{0}(t_{i})\left(\prod_{t=0}^{t_{i}-2}\prod_{j\in\partial i}\left(1-\lambda_{ji}^{t}\theta\left(t-t_{j}\right)\right)-\prod_{t=0}^{t_{i}-1}\prod_{j\in\partial i}\left(1-\lambda_{ji}^{t}\theta\left(t-t_{j}\right)\right)\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This formula is interpretable as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\mathbf{y}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{0}(t_{i})\left(\text{P(NO infection until }t_{i}-2)-\text{P(NO infection until }t_{i}-1)\right).
\]

\end_inset

That difference is of just the probability for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to recieve the infection at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}-1$
\end_inset

 from its neighbours and consequently to become infect at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 By passing to continuous time, the probability density is therefore:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(y\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}^{0}(t_{i})\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\frac{\prod_{j\in\partial i}\exp\left\{ -\intop_{t_{j}}^{t_{i}-\epsilon}\lambda_{ji}^{t}\mathrm{d}t\right\} -\prod_{j\in\partial i}\exp\left\{ -\intop_{t_{j}}^{t_{i}}\lambda_{ji}^{t}\mathrm{d}t\right\} }{\epsilon}.
\]

\end_inset

This is exactly the same formula as before but with continuous time.
 This formula coincides with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Intro:SI_continuous"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ji}^{t}$
\end_inset

 in general is not only dermined by the contact graph, but also by the dynamics.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ji}^{t}$
\end_inset

 typically depends on the infection time of 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $t<t_{j}\,$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ji}^{t}\,$
\end_inset

 is equal to 0.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{j}$
\end_inset

 we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ji}^{t}$
\end_inset

 to grow for some days and then to diminish and reach 0, since the infectinvenes
s needs some time to develop and then reduces in time.
 This example gives us the possibility to notice a first hidden difficulty
 in inference: all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\lambda_{ji}^{t}\}$
\end_inset

 coefficients determine the dynamics, hence the configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 However, their values are dynamics dependent.
 This causes no problem when we simulate the dynamics: a zero patient is
 initialized and every time it infects a new particle it is possible to
 determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ji}^{t}$
\end_inset

 that we need to infect new particles.
 However, when we try to 
\series bold
infere 
\series default
the dynamics, we have no clue on how the epidemics has spread.
 So we find a first nontrivial difficulty: the infection rates both 
\series bold
determine
\series default
 and 
\series bold
are determined
\series default
 by the dynamics.
 This is only one of the difficulties that are not present when generating
 the dynamics and only arise in the inferece.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SEIR Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Susceptive(S) Exposed(E) Infected(I) Recovered(R) model is a slightly
 more general model than the SI.
 Here we have four states.
 A particle S can be infected.
 In that case it becomes E.
 In this state the particle is not able to infect any contact.
 After a random time it becomes I.
 In the state I the particle is able to infect.
 After another random delay it becomes R.
 In this state the particle is not able to infect or to be infected.
 Notice that also in this model the particle can not be I in two different
 periods.
 In fact, the only allowed transitions are 
\begin_inset Formula $S\to E$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\to I$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I\to R$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that this model is not particularly more general than the SI model:
 indeed, if we take an SI model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}^{t}$
\end_inset

 dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}^{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\leq t_{i}$
\end_inset

 and has a gaussian-like shape for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{i}$
\end_inset

 with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}+t^{*}$
\end_inset

, it means that the particle is not immediately infectious (an equivalent
 of the E state).
 Than it becomes infectious (equivalent of I state) and finally, for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>>t^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}^{t}\approx0$
\end_inset

 so that the particle is not infectious (equivalent of the R state).
 We write here the global density probability function directly in the continuou
s formalism.
 In this model the trajectory of the epidemics is fully specified by providing
 for each particle 
\series bold
three
\series default
 times: 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{E},t_{i}^{I},t_{i}^{R}$
\end_inset

 which are respectively the times in which particle 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 becomes E, I and R.
 For a zero patient we have 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{E}=t_{i}^{I}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In general: 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}^{E}\leq t_{i}^{I}\leq t_{i}^{R}.$
\end_inset

 Calling 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\left\{ (t_{i}^{E},t_{i}^{I},t_{i}^{R})\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(y)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\prod_{j}e^{-\intop_{t_{j}^{I}}^{t_{i}^{E}-\epsilon}\lambda_{ji}^{t}\,dt}\bigg|_{\epsilon=0}\right)\nu_{i}^{t_{i}^{I}}\mu_{i}^{t_{i}^{R}}\,\exp\left[-\intop_{t_{i}^{E}}^{t_{i}^{I}}\nu_{i}^{t}dt-\intop_{t_{i}^{I}}^{t_{i}^{R}}\mu_{i}^{t}dt\right]
\]

\begin_layout Subsection
Causality Breaking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inferring the epidemic risk of an individual from the observations is a
 hard problem.
 The main reason is due to 
\series bold
causality breaking
\series default
, namely the phenomenon in which the marginals at a certain time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 also depend on future times 
\begin_inset Formula $t'>t$
\end_inset

, even if the generative model is causal.
 Causality breaking arises from observations.
 Let us give an example in order to better explain this crucial point.
 We consider a population of three interacting individuals A, B and C.
 We introduce, for each individual, the marginal 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

 which is the probability for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to be infected at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=\text{A,B,C}$
\end_inset

.
 If no observation is done on the system, the marginals are connected only
 to the past in a ferromagnetic way.
 This means that, for example, the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t)$
\end_inset

 can be influenced only by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t'<t)$
\end_inset

 which is the past story of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and by the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B,C}(t'<t)$
\end_inset

 which is the effect that B and C have had over A in time.
 If we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}(s)$
\end_inset

, than 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t>s)$
\end_inset

 is increased.
 This is very intuitive.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is more probable to be infected at a certain time, it will infect 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with higher probability.
 Consequently, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t>s)$
\end_inset

 is increased too.
 However, as soon as an observation is performed on the system, many non
 trivial effects arise.
 For example, let us suppose to observe the particle A to be S at time 0.
 Then we observe that A is I at time T.
 It means that either B or C have infected A in the time interval [0,T].
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}(t)$
\end_inset

 strongly depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{C}(t'>t)$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{C}(s<\approx T)$
\end_inset

 is very low, it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}(t<s)$
\end_inset

 is very high! In the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{C}(T)=0$
\end_inset

 indeed, the zero patient is necessairily 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}(t)=1$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We see that the marginals of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are connected at every time.
 Moreover, we observe a sort of antiferromagnetic behaviour (which is not
 present in the generating dynamics!): 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}(t)$
\end_inset

 must be high if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}(s>t)$
\end_inset

 is low.

\begin_layout Subsection
Generating vs Inferencial model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example above is useful to understand that inferring a causal dynamics
 requires taking into account non causal effects.
 Even the physics behind the Inferential process might be richer that the
 one of the generating dynamics.
 This makes the inferential problem very hard, since it is necessary to
 define a more general model that is able to catch the features of the generatin
g dynamics and to correct them with the non causal effects due to observations.

\begin_layout Section
The Causality ansatz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of Causality is to infere the epidemic process by introducing an
 inferencial model which is formally very similar to the generating model.
 In partiular, the idea is to impose the inferencial model to be 
\series bold
causal.
 
\series default
The functional form of the probability distribution is very similar to the
 generating model, but the parameters of the functions are inferred.
 This makes causality technique very flexible, since the ansats is built
 directly by slightly modifying the generating model.
 Another advantage is the interpretability of the inferred model.
 Causality inference, in fact, can be interpreted as the best causal model
 inferring the observations.
 By looking at some examples this is made clearer
